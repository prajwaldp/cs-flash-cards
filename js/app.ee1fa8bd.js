Actors aren’t like threads, but messages sent to them are pushed through on a thread at some point in time. How actors are connected to threads is configurable - this is not a hardwired relationship.\\r\\nFor now the most important aspect of actors is that you build applications by sending and receiving messages. A message could be processed locally on some available thread, or remotely on another server. Exactly where the message is processed and where the actor lives are things you can decide later, which is very different compared to hardcoding threads and RPC style networking.

As we will discuss later, suppliers have added resiliency with products that duplicate writes.

Such drawings are easy to program and fast to construct. They have the substantial advantage that no two edges will obscure each other, since no three vertices will be collinear. Such artifacts can be hard to avoid as soon as you allow internal vertices into your drawing. An unexpected pleasure with circular drawings is the symmetry sometimes revealed because vertices appear in the order they were inserted into the graph. Simulated annealing can be used to permute the circular vertex order to minimize crossings or edge length, and thus significantly improve the drawing. A good, general purpose graph-drawing heuristic models the graph as a system of springs and then uses energy minimization to space the vertices. Let adjacent vertices attract each other with a force proportional to (say) the logarithm of their separation, while all nonadjacent vertices repel each other with a force proportional to their separation distance. These weights provide incentive for all edges to be as short as possible, while spreading the vertices apart. The behavior of such a system can be approximated by determining the force acting on each vertex at a particular time and then moving each vertex a small amount in the appropriate direction.

However, faster times are possible by using suffix trees. Build a tree containing all suffixes of all strings of S.

By the time the instruction jnz completes execution (assuming the zero flag is clear, so that the branch is taken), we\'ve already started five other instructions and we\'re only one clock cycle away from the completion of the first of these.

At run time, the system places all automatic variables (non-static local variables), subroutine parameters, temporary values, and other objects in the stack section of memory in a special data structure we call the activation record (which is aptly named because the system creates an activation record when a subroutine first begins execution, and it deallocates the activation record when the subroutine returns to its caller).","show_count":0},"1638":{"type":1,"question":"What is the different between a hardware stack and a software stack?","answer":"If a CPU provides an explicit stack-pointer register (ESP), we say that the CPU supports a hardware stack; if only a general-purpose register is available, then we say that the CPU uses a software-implemented stack.","show_count":0},"1639":{"type":1,"question":"What are anonymous variables?","answer":"We\'ll usually refer to objects in heap memory as anonymous variables because we refer to them by their memory address (via pointers) rather than by a name.","show_count":0},"1640":{"type":1,"question":"What is a simple heap manager implementation?","answer":"Easy implementation of a heap manager that supports garbage collection.

Fragmentation occurs after a long sequence of allocation and deallocation requests. Remember, when the heap manager satisfies a memory allocation request, it usually creates two blocks of memory — one in-use block for the request and one free block that contains the remaining bytes in the original block after the request is filled (assuming the heap manager did not find an exact fit). After operating for a while, the best-fit algorithm may wind up producing lots of smaller, leftover blocks of memory that are too small to satisfy an average memory request (because the best-fit algorithm also produces the smallest leftover blocks as a result of its behavior).","show_count":0},"1643":{"type":1,"question":"How does heap memory allocation optimize for speed?","answer":"If an application calls the operating system for every memory request it makes, the performance of the application will probably suffer if the application makes several memory allocation and deallocation calls.

When we traverse an edge from a visited vertex v to a new vertex w, we change the edge (v, w) stored in v\'s adjacency list to point back to v\'s parent in the DFS tree.
